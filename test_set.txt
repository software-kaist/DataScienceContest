HWT 14V023000 , Kia Motors Corporation (Kia) is recalling certain model year 2014 Kia Sportage vehicles manufactured September 30, 2013, through January 11, 2014.

Thus, these vehicles do not conform to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 110, "Tire Selection and Rims for Passenger Cars." Maintaining tire pressure below the recommmend specification could result in premature tire wear, increasing the risk of a crash. Kia will notify owners, and dealers will correct the label information, and owners will also receive a sticker to put into the owners manual, free of charge.

ETC 14V004000 , Glaval Bus is recalling certain model year 2010-2013 Universal, Entourage, Concorde II, Titan, Titan II and Legacy  transit buses manufactured June 1, 2010, through June 30, 2013, and equipped with a Ford 5.4L or 6.8L engine and a Trans/Air-brand air conditioner.  In the affected vehicles, depending on the routing of the alternator harness, and the orientation of the heater hose spring clamp at the front of the intake manifold, the alternator harness may be pinched between the spring clamp and the air conditioner compressor mounting bracket.
