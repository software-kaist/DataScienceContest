SWT 15V100000 , Hyundai Motor America (Hyundai) is recalling certain model year 2008-2010 Elantra vehicles manufactured June 1, 2008, to April 30, 2010, and 2009-2010 Elantra Touring vehicles manufactured November 1, 2008, to April 30, 2010.

If power steering assist is lost, greater driver effort would be required to steer the vehicle at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash. Hyundai will notify owners, and dealers will verify the proper operation of the Electronic Power Steering and update the EPS control unit, free of charge. The manufacturer has not yet provided a notification schedule. Owners may contact Hyundai customer service at 1-855-671-3059. Hyundai's number for this recall is 127.
SWT 15V218000 , Hyundai Motor America (Hyundai) is recalling certain model year 2015 Accent vehicles manufactured September 15, 2014, to February 10, 2015.  In very cold temperatures, the occupant detection system (ODS) may not be able to determine if a child restraint seat is in the front passenger seat. If the ODS fails to detect that the seat is occupied by a child restraint seat, the front air bag will not be deactivated and, in the event of a crash necessitating front air bag deployment, the air bag deployment could cause increased risk of injury to the occupant in the child restraint seat. Hyundai will notify owners, and dealers will correct ODS software, free of charge.  The recall began on June 4, 2015.  Owners may contact Hyundai customer service at 1-855-671-3059.

In the affected vehicles, the parking lights do not reduce their light output from a DRL level when used in conjunction with the headlights.  As such, the light output may exceed the the permissable amount allowed by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 108, "Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment." If the light output is excessive, oncoming traffic may be temporarily blinded, increasing the risk of a crash.

The affected vehicles have LED tail lights that may not light on the sides, reducing the rear side visibility of the vehicle.  As such, these vehicles fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108, "Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment." Reduced rear side marker illumination may prevent other drivers from seeing the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash.

SWT 15V288000 , Daimler Buses North America (DBNA) is recalling certain model year 2007-2012 Orion VII natural gas-powered transit buses manufactured January 1, 2007, to October 1, 2012.  Excessive engine crankcase pressures may cause the 90-degree elbow of the vent tube assembly to detach from the crankcase ventilation breather, possibly allowing engine oil to come into contact with hot surfaces. If the engine oil comes into contact with hot surfaces, it can increase the risk of a vehicle fire. Cummins will notify owners on behalf of DBNA, and dealers will secure the ends of the 90-degree elbow.  In addition, the electronic control module (ECM) will be reprogrammed with software that can adjust the engine output under misfire conditions to limit crankcase pressures.  These repairs will be performed free of charge.  The recall began on June 12, 2015.  Owners may contact DBNA at 1-905-403-7807 or Cummins Inc. at 1-800-343-7357.
